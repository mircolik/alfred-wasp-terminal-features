# alfred-warp-terminal-features

This repository contains an Alfred feature for WARP, an alternative terminal for macOS.

## Description

The code I provided is an AppleScript that can be used with the Alfred app to open or activate the WARP terminal application and execute specified keystrokes. It first checks if WARP is running and if not, it opens a new window. It then executes the specified keystrokes, which in this case is the input provided by the user. This allows for quick and easy access to WARP through the use of Alfred.

## Installation

To use this AppleScript code with the Alfred app, follow these steps:

1. Open Alfred Preferences
2. Click on "Features"
3. Click on "Terminal"
4. Under "Application," select "Custom"
5. Copy and paste the [AppleScript](https://github.com/mircolik/alfred-wasp-terminal-features/blob/main/alfred_wasp_feature.scpt) code into the text box

After completing these steps, you should be able to activate the script by invoking Alfred and typing in the keyword specified in the Alfred workflow, which should open or activate the Warp application and execute the specified keystrokes.
